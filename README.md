# MASH-Peformance-Analytics
This project was for a DSC 4990: Senior Project/Portfolio.

# Step 1: Clean Data, Create Unique PlayerID, and Merge Datasets
- Initial data was housed in three main Excel sheets: player metadata, performance history, and strength history
- In order to keep player data anonymous, a unique player ID was generated in Excel for each player within the Player sheet
- Then the index/match function was used to match these player IDs to other player occurrences in both the performance and strenght history sheets based on player name
- Data was cleaned (trimming spaces, correcting spelling errors in names) until all player IDs were matched to the rows in the performance and strength history sheets.

# Step 2: Analysis in Python Using Visual Studio Code


# Step 3: Creating Dashboard in PowerBI


# Step 4: Creating Dashboard in Tableau
